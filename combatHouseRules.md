# Combat House Rules
The following house rules are added in to the D&D 5e Combat rules.  The goal is to give more options for thinking out of the box for fighting enemies, and to reward tactical and creative play.

These are in addition to the Actions and alternate Attacks listed in the core rules - https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#ActionsinCombat

## Flanking
By working together with your allies, you are able to flank enemies and make it easier to attack them.

When flanking an enemy, you gain advantage to your attack rolls against the opponent.
### How to Flank

To flank an enemy, you and an ally must be adjacent to the enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space.

When in doubt about whether two characters flank an enemy, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the characters' squares.  If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked.

In order to flank an enemy, you and your ally must be able to attack the enemy, whether you're armed or unarmed.

### Flanking and Larger Creatures

If a flanking creature's space takes up more than 1 square, the create flanks an enemy if any square it occupies counts for flanking.


## Additional Action Options
This section provides new action options for combat.
They can be added as a group or individually to
your game.

### Climb onto a Bigger Creature
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it
can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has
little chance of making a successful grapple against a
Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic
has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be
treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its
back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability
checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger
creature, the sma ller creature uses its action to make
a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully
moves into the target creature's space and clings to its
body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature
moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls
against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the
larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult
terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the
smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's
location, and is left to your discretion. The larger
creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an
action- knocking it off, scraping it against a wall,
or grabbing and throwing it- by making a Strength
(Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

### Called Shots
Called Shots provide a way for combatants to attack specific body parts of creatures.  This can be used to hinder a foe, or to disable a body part of a larger creature that is capable of taking extrordinary action.

A called shot can be made as part of an attack; in doing so, the attacker identifies the body part being targetted, and makes the attack at disadvantage.  On a successful attack, the target takes damage to that body part, and any addition effect of the called shot occurs.

A called shot cannot be made if the attacker already has disadvantage from another source.

#### Called Shots and Medium or Smaller Creatures

A medium creature is too small for damage to a specific limb to disable it, without disabling the creature.  Medium or smaller creatures take standard damage from a called shot.  In addition, based off of the body part targetted, the attacked creature suffers the following penalties:
* **Head** - The creature suffers disadvantage on any checks to maintain concentration, and suffers disadvantage to their next Intelligence or Wisdom check.
* **Body** - No additional effect.
* **Arms** - The creature suffers disadvantage to the next attack roll that they make with a weapon or unarmed attack.
* **Hands** - If the creature is holding something other than a weapon or shield, they drop it.
* **Legs** - The creature's movement is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

Specific medium creatures may have exceptions to this, based off of gear or body shape.

#### Called Shots and Larger Creatures

Larger creatures often have more body types than identified in the previous section.  These body types are often able to make special attacks or grant special abilities, like a manticore's tail sting or flight.


These body parts have their own portion of the creature's HP total.  When attacked, the body parts suffer damage, as does the creature as a whole.  When a body part's HP is reduced to 0, any associated special attacks or abilities are unable to be used.



The Dungeon Master should explain the body parts and the special attacks to the players based off of what their characters can see and observe.



These body parts are generally broken up in to two categories, although a creature may have an exception.

* **Large Body Parts** - Have 1/4th of the total HP of the creature.
* **Small Body Parts** - Have 1/8th of the total HP of the creature.

The total number of body parts of a creature is thus constrainted to between 4 and 8.

Large Humanoids, like Ogres, will have the same body parts as Medium creatures, each one taking up 1/5th of their HP, and will suffer the negative effects as though a Medium or Smaller creature, as well as any effects based on their body parts.

### Disarm
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon
or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker
makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength
(Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the
attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage
or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if
the target is holding the item with two or more hands.
The target has advantage on its ability check if it is
larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it
is smaller.

### Mark
This option makes it easier for melee combatants to
harry each other with opportunity attacks.

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also
mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn,
any opportunity attack it makes against the marked
target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't
expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't
make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated
condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it
from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one
opportunity attack per turn.



### Overrun
When a creature tries to move through a hostile
creature's space, the mover can try to force its way
through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an
action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength
(Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's
Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the
overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than
the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If
the mover wins the contest, it can move through the
hostile creature's space once this turn.

### Shove Aside
With this option, a creature uses the special shove
attack (https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#ShovingaCreature) from the Basic Rules to force a target
to the side, rather than away. The attacker has
disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it
does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves
the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.



### Tumble
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's
space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an
action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the
contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space
once this turn.




## Morale Checks
Morale Checks are Wisdom checks that NPCs make when threatened.  It represents the NPC having the heart, focus, or training to keep fighting in the face of a real threat.

### When to make a Morale Check
Most creatures make a Morale Check when they are bloodied (reach 1/2 HP or fewer) the first time in a combat.  However, some might have special traits or training that change this:

* Creatures that are **Easily Shaken** make a Morale Check at 3/4 of their total HP.  This should be used for creatures that are not going to fight for victory, like animals that are hunting.
* Creatures that are **Determined** make a Morale Check at 1/4 of their total HP.  This should be used for creatures that are powerful and prideful, like a fanatical cult leader or a tyrannical dragon.



### DCs for Morale Checks
An NPC's background, training, and current circumstances.  There are three difficulty levels:
* **DC 12** for standard creature and/or circumstances.
* **DC 17** for when a creature is inheriently cowardly, or for when circumstances stacked against the NPC, such as being heavily out numbered or is in the presence of something they are afraid of.
* **DC 7** for creatures with training and experience, or for when circumstances favor the creature, such as out numbering their enemy or in the presence of something they fear more than death.



### Failing a Morale Check
If an NPC fails a Morale Check, their morale breaks and they begin to act to achieve something other than victory in combat.  Each creature has a specific behavior for when its morale breaks; the following are standard behaviors.

* **Panicked** creatures drop any weapons and run as far and as fast as they can, heedless of opportunity attacks.
* **Routed** creatures keep their weapons, and begin to withdraw and move away without drawing additional attacks, but do not try to protect their allies.
* **Retreating** creatures behave as Routed, but they attempt to protect their allies and disengage as a group.
* **Surrendering** creatures make it clear that they don't want to fight, and put theirself in the mercy of their opponents.
* **Enraged** creatures keep fighting, but stop recognizing allies - this doesn't mean that they attack their allies right away, but it means that they cannot use effects that key off of being allied with another creature.  If there are no enemies around, they will then begin to attack their former allies.
* **Traiterous** creatures turn on their allies - either for revenge against a former ally, or to put themselves in to a good position with the party for forgiveness.  This is often used for creatures that are enslaved or otherwise compelled. 

Some creatures might have other behaviors, and even gain some kind of benefit or penalty.
