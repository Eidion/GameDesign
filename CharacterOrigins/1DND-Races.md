# "One Dungeons & Dragons" Compatible Origins

As part of planning for the 2024 "revision" of the 5e Players Handbook, Wizards of the Coast has released a [playtest for character origins](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/character-origins/CSWCVV0M4B6vX6E1/UA2022-CharacterOrigins.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest1).  As part of this, they have included revised races.  The Half-Elf and Half-Orc races are removed, and replaced with a new system.  

In this system, if you are a child of two humanoid races, such as Elf and Human, you:

- Pick one of the parent races that gives you your size, speed, and special traits.
- Describe your character visually however you would like.
- Use the average of their lifespans.

To me this system is unfulfilling, for a variety of reasons.

First, half-elves are one of my favorite player races because I like their flavor, and I like their mechanical niches.  In general, they have two niches which I have seen used to great effect and to create memorable characters:

- Half-elves as a team builder.  Half-elves who grew up dealing with different groups of people learned how to work as part of diverse groups.  These characters have developed sharp social skills, and techniques and abilities that bring diverse teams together and help them become friends.
- Half-elves as multidisciplinary masters.  Half-elves who combine human drive and elven skill are able to make excellent dabblers or masters of multiple skillsets, such as fighter/wizards.

These are sometimes combined, which works great for Bards, Paladins, and Rangers who have both a team and multidisciplinary approach.

While half-orcs tend not to be my cup of tea, there are others who are just as passionate about the half-orcs.

Secondly, I think that in the context of D&D, the half-elf is a character archtype that should be supported.  Removing this takes away something that a high number of players enjoy.  In the [2018 analysis of D&D Beyond Character Data](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-your-dd-character-rare/), half-elves were #3 over all, and half-orcs were #9.  If [other analysis](https://www.geeknative.com/103964/the-most-popular-dd-races-in-dd-beyond-in-2020/) is to be believed, then half-elves have only grew due to popularity.

This may be because of mechanical incentives, but the fact remains that removing this race is removing support for a popular option.  Something that I don't think should be done.  Both from a player support perspective, and from a game history perspective.

Third, I play D&D more than, say, Savage Worlds, because the rule widgets mean more.  I am not creating and shaping my own thing, I am participating in a shared experience and with a ruleset that means something.

For example, if I say "I played a dwarf barbarian" then someone will have a very different picture of what I mean than if I said "I played a halfling barbarian."  Taking a popular choice and removing the rules around it blurs this line, and reduces the shared experience between different people.

In addition, if there are no significant rules difference, then my characters doesn't *feel* different in interacting with the rules of the game world.  It removes a distinct feeling.

Personally, once you start saying "Use this rule block but explain it however you want," I have a negative reaction.  If that is the case, why not use the human rules and have everyone explain it differently?  Why not have everyone play a fighter but describe things differently?  There has to be a line to be drawn, and drawing it on this side of classic character origins feels like a bad call.

While all of this is being presented as a playtest, the fact is that many systems, such as Pathfinder 2, have opted for this system.  I want to plan for this to go through, even if I hope it does not - and will be giving my feedback accordingly!

To that end, I want to present a half-elf and half-orc race, built in the structure of the play test.  I also want these to better represent the unique niches that I see for these characters.

## Character Races

### Half-Elf

Found anywhere where there are humans and elves, half-elves are more than just a blend of their two parents.  While they live longer than humans, and stay vital up until their final fates, they do live a shorter time than elves.  This places them in a strange position among communities.  This often drives them to live in diverse communities, and to make friends and allies among many people.

Half-elves inherit the human drive and ambition, as well as elven adaptability.  While they do not have the mystical ability to magically bond with environments and be transformed by them, they are able to mentally adapt to many scenarios and situations.  This, combined with their human drive, makes half-elves capable of periods of great focus as well as the ability to change tasks and life paths easily.

Driven enough to overcome all obstacles, and adaptable enough to learn and grow as challenges emerge, half-elves often find unique places for themselves in their worlds.

Resembling a blend of both parents physically, half-elves share humanity's diverse appearance while inherieting their elven ancestry's pointed ears.  They have sparse body hair, but are able to grow beards.
