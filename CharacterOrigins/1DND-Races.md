# "One Dungeons & Dragons" Compatible Origins

As part of planning for the 2024 "revision" of the 5e Players Handbook, Wizards of the Coast has released a [playtest for character origins](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/character-origins/CSWCVV0M4B6vX6E1/UA2022-CharacterOrigins.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest1).  As part of this, they have included revised races.  The Half-Elf and Half-Orc races are removed, and replaced with a new system.  

In this system, if you are a child of two humanoid races, such as Elf and Human, you:

- Pick one of the parent races that gives you your size, speed, and special traits.
- Describe your character visually however you would like.
- Use the average of their lifespans.

To me this system is unfulfilling, for a variety of reasons.

First, half-elves are one of my favorite player races because I like their flavor, and I like their mechanical niches.  In general, they have two niches which I have seen used to great effect and to create memorable characters:

- Half-elves as a team builder.  Half-elves who grew up dealing with different groups of people learned how to work as part of diverse groups.  These characters have developed sharp social skills, and techniques and abilities that bring diverse teams together and help them become friends.
- Half-elves as multidisciplinary masters.  Half-elves who combine human drive and elven skill are able to make excellent dabblers or masters of multiple skillsets, such as fighter/wizards.

These are sometimes combined, which works great for Bards, Paladins, and Rangers who have both a team and multidisciplinary approach.

While half-orcs tend not to be my cup of tea, there are others who are just as passionate about the half-orcs.

Secondly, I think that in the context of D&D, the half-elf is a character archtype that should be supported.  Removing this takes away something that a high number of players enjoy.  In the [2018 analysis of D&D Beyond Character Data](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-your-dd-character-rare/), half-elves were #3 over all, and half-orcs were #9.  If [other analysis](https://www.geeknative.com/103964/the-most-popular-dd-races-in-dd-beyond-in-2020/) is to be believed, then half-elves have only grew due to popularity.

This may be because of mechanical incentives, but the fact remains that removing this race is removing support for a popular option.  Something that I don't think should be done.  Both from a player support perspective, and from a game history perspective.

Third, I play D&D more than, say, Savage Worlds, because the rule widgets mean more.  I am not creating and shaping my own thing, I am participating in a shared experience and with a ruleset that means something.

For example, if I say "I played a dwarf barbarian" then someone will have a very different picture of what I mean than if I said "I played a halfling barbarian."  Taking a popular choice and removing the rules around it blurs this line, and reduces the shared experience between different people.

In addition, if there are no significant rules difference, then my characters doesn't *feel* different in interacting with the rules of the game world.  It removes a distinct feeling.

Personally, once you start saying "Use this rule block but explain it however you want," I have a negative reaction.  If that is the case, why not use the human rules and have everyone explain it differently?  Why not have everyone play a fighter but describe things differently?  There has to be a line to be drawn, and drawing it on this side of classic character origins feels like a bad call.

While all of this is being presented as a playtest, the fact is that many systems, such as Pathfinder 2, have opted for this system.  I want to plan for this to go through, even if I hope it does not - and will be giving my feedback accordingly!

To that end, I want to present a half-elf and half-orc race, built in the structure of the play test.  I also want these to better represent the unique niches that I see for these characters.

## Character Races

### Half-Elf

Found anywhere where there are humans and elves, half-elves are more than just a blend of their two parents.  While they live longer than humans, and stay vital up until their final fates, they do live a shorter time than elves.  This places them in a strange position among communities.  This often drives them to live in diverse communities, and to make friends and allies among many people.

Half-elves inherit the human drive and ambition, as well as elven adaptability.  While they do not have the mystical ability to magically bond with environments and be transformed by them, they are able to mentally adapt to many scenarios and situations.  This, combined with their human drive, makes half-elves capable of periods of great focus as well as the ability to change tasks and life paths easily.

Driven enough to overcome all obstacles, and adaptable enough to learn and grow as challenges emerge, half-elves often find unique places for themselves in their worlds.

Resembling a blend of both parents physically, half-elves share humanity's diverse appearance while inherieting their elven ancestry's pointed ears.  They have sparse body hair, but are able to grow beards.  


#### Half-Elf Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid.  
**Size:** Medium (about 4-7 feet tall)  
**Speed:** 30 feet  
**Life Span:** 400 years on average

As a Half-Elf, you have these special traits.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Fey Ancestry.*** You have Advantage on saving 
throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed 
Condition on yourself.

***Dual Heritage.***  You are considered to be an elf or a human for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf or human.

***Inspirational.*** You can grant inspiration to one ally Inspiration* whenever you finish a Long Rest.

***Dilettante.*** You have dabbled in lessons outside of your main skillset, and grown your proficiencies and abilities as a result.  Choose two of the following:

- **Skill Dilettante.** You gain proficiency with one Skill or tool.
- **Weapons Dilettante.** You gain proficiency with two weapons.
- **Armor Dilettante.** You gain proficiency with light.  If your class grants you profiency with light armor, you also gain proficiency with medium armor and shields.  If your class grants you profiency with medium armor and shields, you gain profiency with heavy armor.
- **Magic Dilettante.** You learn two cantrips of your choice.  Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these Spells (Select when taking this ability)

#### Design Notes

Initial balance was guided by the following thought process:

- Dual Heritage is a ribbon that does not warrant serious mechanical consideration.
- Fey Ancestry and Dark Vision are worth a little more than a skill.
- Inspirational is equivelent to Skillful in the human traits, and worth the secondary elf traits.
- Dilettante is worth between 1/2 a feat and a whole feat, which is about worth the elven magical abilities.
  - A skill is worth 1/3 of a feat.
  - Profiency with two weapons is worth 1/4 a feat.
  - Light and medium armor is worth
    - Light armor proof is worth 1/2 feat.
    - Medium armor and shields are worth 1/2 a feat.
    - Heavy armor is worth 1/2 a feat.
  - Two cantrips are worth between 1/2 and 2/3 a feat.

### Half-Orc

#### Design Notes

Half-Orcs are a challenge to me because I have never been a big fan of them, but have played with people who enjoy them.  

My initial research indicates that the following are among the reasons people like to play them: 

- To play a character that is visibly monsterous.
- To play a character who is an outcast.
- To explore dark emotions or themes.
- To play a character who is strong and fast.
- To play a character who is part of a culture that values primal tropes.

However, there are a lot of existing options for this:

- Any character can be an outcast - that is more of a background over all.
- Dragonborn are strong and visibly monsterous.
- Tieflings work great for dark emotions or themes, and for playing a monsterous or outcast character.
- Goliaths are strong and primal.
- With orc as a main option, all of these boxes can be checked as well.

In fact, it seems like the *main* reason for playing a half-orc in previous iterations was "to play an orc, but make it be more socially acceptable."

With the necessary move to stop painting humanoid races as more or less worthy of life, liberty, and status as a viable Player Character, a lot of these attributes need to be pulled away from the race and placed on other aspects of the origin, or be tied to the game world's culture and not tied to the race.

For example, it is reasonable for a DM to say:

> Because of the border wars with the orc tribes, orcs have disadvantage on Charisma based checks with Hostile or Indifferent villagers.  Some villagers will also be Hostile by default.

However, it isn't reasonable to tie this to the race itself, such that:

> **Stigma.**  Orcs suffer disadvantage on Charisma based checks with Humans, because of the border wars between their people.

In the first example, the outcast/social situation is attached to the village and is part of a situation.  In the other, it is a trait of the race itself, which should be avoided.

So with the orc becoming a viable player character race, is there a reason to play a half-orc?  And if so, what is it?

One thing I identified in my research was the idea of "making the most of a difficult situation."  That's something that isn't found with the full orc.
