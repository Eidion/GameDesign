# Backgrounds

>Backgrounds might be getting merged in to classes.  Keeping this around to re-valuate some stuff.

Your Background is who you are in the world; it is where you come from and how you think of yourself.  It is a combination of the physical traits you inherieted from your birth parents, and the culture that you grew up in.

These backgrounds will give you additional skill levels, as well as some things like equipment or additional traits.
