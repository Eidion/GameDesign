# Actions

Actions are things your character does in the game world.  They are anything your character wants to try to do - picking a lock, convincing a king to send troops to aid a village, attacking a dragon with a sword, casting a spell.


## Resolving Actions

In general, the Story Teller will describe a scene or situation, and you will have your character take an action to influence the scene, change the situation, or to explore the world more.

If this is something that your character can do with no chance of failure, or no consequences for failure, then your character should be able to do it.  Then the Story Teller will explain how your action changed the scene or situation, or what new scene or situation emerges from your actions - such as having more knowledge or a reaction from another character.

If this action is something that the character might not be able to do, or will have a consequence for failing, then the Story Teller might ask you to make a Skill roll.

In short, to make a Skill roll, you roll <img src="img/d20.png" alt="d20" width="25"/> and then add your [Skill Die](3-Skills.md#skill-die).  See [Skills](3-Skills.md) for more information about having Skills, Skillsets, and Skill dice.

### Difficulty and Target Numbers

>It should be noted that these DCs are pretty swingy.  More playtesting is needed.

As a Story Teller, before asking for a Skill roll, decide what the Difficulty and Target Number for the Skill roll is.  You should rarely ask for a roll without having a clear Target Number in mind.

Remember, if a player's character could accomplish their Action with no real chance of failure so long as they take their time, and there is no consequence for failure, don't ask the character to roll.

The Target Number is what the player needs to roll on their Skill Roll (<img src="img/d20.png" alt="d20" width="25"/> and and their [Skill Die](3-Skills.md#skill-die)) in order to succeed.

| Difficulty | Target Number |
|-|-|
| Trivial | 6 |
| Very Easy | 8 |
| Easy | 10 | 
| Challenging | 12 |
| Hard | 15 | 
| Overwhelming | 17 |
| Impossible | 20 |

If a character beats a roll by *more than 5*, then you can reward them with a **Critical Success** which gives them some kind of bonus - you decide what it is, and you only need to reward it if it makes sense in the scene.

You might want to ask the player what they might want for a critical success.

If a character fails a roll by *more than 5*, then you can reward them with a **Critical Failure** which gives them some kind of penalty - you decide what it is, and you only need to reward it if it makes sense in the scene.

Don't feel like you have to give a Critical Success or Failure every time.  Use it only when it makes sense as part of the scene.

### Opposed Skill Rolls

Some challenges will be done between characters.  For example, if two characters are in a dancing competition, then assigning a Target Number might not make sense.

Instead, have the characters (player characters and non-player characters) make a Skill roll and compare the results.  Whoever is higher would be the winner.

Depending on the situation, there might be both a Target Number (to decide *if* a character is able to do something) and an Opposed Skill Roll (to decide *how well* a character did something in comparison to someone else).

If two characters are trying to bake a pie for a pie tasting contest, there might be a Target Number of 10 to see if they could even make a pie that the judges would accept.  Then, whoever rolled higher would have a tastier pie - at least, taking in consideration for things like taste and judges' preferences. 



### Situational Bonuses

A **Situational Bonus** is something that is applied to the roll based on how the character is attempting to take the action.  They are based off of the scene or having the right equipment.

For example, in our pie tasting competition example using blueberries in your pie might give you a situational bonus if a judge loves blueberries.

If they hate blueberries, you might get a **Situational Penalty**.  This would be something to subtract from your roll.

Most situational bonuses or penalties should be <img src="img/d4.png" alt="d4" width="25"/>.  If one is is very important, than <img src="img/d6.png" alt="d6" width="25"/> could be used instead.

Some equipment, especially magic items, might have their own situational bonuses.

For example, a magic sword might give a situational bonus of <img src="img/d4.png" alt="d4" width="25"/> when you are attacking an enemy.  Or some armor might give a bonus of <img src="img/d6.png" alt="d6" width="25"/> on rolls dealing with fire, but a penalty of <img src="img/d4.png" alt="d4" width="25"/> when dealing with water.

Equipment will describe their own situational bonuses.

When applying multiple Situational modifiers, follow these two rules:

- A penalty and a bonus of the same dice should cancel each other out.
- After they are canceled out, apply no more than two bonuses or penalties.
