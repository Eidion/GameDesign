# Daring Deeds Quick Rules

## Making a Character!

- Select a name, and write it on your character sheet!
- Select a Class and write it on your character sheet!
  - A Class is what you do in the world.  It’s a bit of your job, and a bit of your skills.
  - Each Class has things that they are Great At, Good At, and Bad At.
  - Mark these down on your character sheet!
  - Your Class also has equipment, write these down!
- Select a Background!  
  - A Background is who you are in the world; it is where you come from and how you think of yourself.
  - Each Background helps you be Good At something.
  - Mark down what you are Good At!  
  - If you are already Good At it, you are Great At it!  
  - If you are already Great At it, pick something else to be Good At!
- You are Okay At everything else!

## Playing the Game!

- Listen to what the Storyteller says is going on, then decide what you want to do.
- You might have to roll!  The Storyteller will tell you what number you need to roll against.  If another character is trying to stop you, their player or the Storyteller might roll against yours!
- The Storyteller tells you what happens!

## Getting into a Fight!

- If you get in to a fight, you roll against whoever you are fighting.
  - If you are fighting with weapons or fists, you roll Striking/Protecting against each other.
- Whoever loses the roll, loses a ♥! 
- If a character has no more ♥, they can't make rolls or take actions - the Storyteller will tell you what happens!
