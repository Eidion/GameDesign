## Skills and Skillsets

A **Skill** is the result of your training, either as part of your background, your class, or training you have made through leveling up.  Individual Skills are grouped in to 10 **Skillsets**:

- Striking, Protecting, and Carrying
- Dodging, Sneaking, and Shooting
- Magic, Figuring, and Learning
- Healing, Feeling, and Hoping
- Hearing, Listening, and Noticing
- Navigating, Hunting, and Exploring
- Singing, Talking, and Making Friends
- Leading, Demanding, and Scaring
- Running, Climbing, Swimming
- Jumping, Balancing, Dancing

The Skills in a Skillset are related - getting better at one makes you better at all of them.  For example, learning to be a better leader (the Leading skill) makes you more confident and imposing, making it easier for you to make demands (Demanding) or to bully or frighten someone (Scaring).

## Skill Levels

For each skillset, you have a **Skill Level**.  There are five levels in all.

You can be **Bad At** a Skillset, meaning that you are not very good at using it.  This is generally something that you neglected to learn in your background or class training.  You can still try your best, but it might be hard to succeed.

You can be **Okay At** a Skillset, meaning that you are about as good with it as anyone else is.  This is something that you haven't worked hard to learn, but have picked up a bit.  You would have an okay chance at succeeding, but you will still have plenty of failures if a challenge is difficult.  Most characters will be Okay At most of their skills.

You can be **Good At** a Skillset, meaning that you are better than most with it.  You have worked to learn this Skillset, and feel comfortable using it in a variety of situations.  You can expect to succeed against many challenges, but high difficulty challenges can still hinder you.

You can be **Great At** a Skillset, meaning that you have spent a lot of time and energy mastering it.  You are better than almost anyone at it, and people are impressed at your skill in this area.  You can expect to succeed against most challenges; even high difficulty challenges
