# Faerie Court Knights

The Knights of the Four Courts are the champions of each faction, the leaders of their armies, and the defenders of their honor.  

Each knight has their own philosophy and style of battle, and their own motivations for engaging in battle.  They are as different from each other as their courts.

### Description

Zarion is a graceful and charming faerie lord who appears elf-like, with golden hair and a well toned build.  He is clad in white and gold hues, including a golden cloak and shimmering armor.

In battle he carries his *Radiant Blade* and *Mirror Shield* proudly; while these are not as powerful as many weapons of the archfey, Zarion uses them to great effect to lead the Spring Court.

Zarion favors using his strength and skills to help lead his fellows in battle, favoring protective magic, healing, and guidance over raw power.  This makes him an invulable asset to the Spring Court, whose members often lack personal power.  He is a successful teacher, and delights in helping his students shine, both on and off the battlefield.

Zarion served in the Summer Court before the Equinox Wars, only coming to Lenola's service after seeing her kindness in action.  A relatively young faerie lord, he was the most promising student of Etelgarth before becoming a renowned knight on his own.  He earned the title of Knight of Bright Dawn due to his use of radiant magic, as well as his bright and shining personality.

Zarion enjoys celebrations, music, and dancing.  He can be an incouragable flirt with a receptive partner, but does not push his advances where not needed.  He has had many lovers, and no small number of elves can trace their ancestry back to his relationships.

### Description

The most senior champion knight, Etelgarth has served Queen Titania since before the Equinox War, and was even involved in the war against the Formorians.  Despite his loyalty, his focus is on building his own power, and he favors exercising his own might instead of using strategies, teamwork, or tricks.

Like many of the knights, he is motivated by the prestige gained by his position.  However, unlike the others, he has no deeper motive.

Brutally honest and direct, Etelgarth has little time for converation or pleasantries, and does not appreciate subtlety on or off the battlefield.  This has caused him to have many defeats, most often at the hands of Rowan, who has a reputation for favoring trickery to a stand up fight.
