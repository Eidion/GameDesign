### Reactions

**Guardian Teleport.**  When an ally that Zarion can see within 60 feet is hit by an attack, Zarion can use his reaction to teleport adjacent to the ally and the attack targets him instead.  If the attack would fail to hit him, it is a miss.

**Mirror Shield.**  When Zarion would take cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, he can use his reaction to gain immunity to the energy type until the beginning of his next turn.  In addition, he can target one creature within 60 feet of him; that creature must make a DC 19 reflex save, or take the damage that Zarion would have taken if not for his immunity.

### Description

Zarion is a graceful and charming faerie lord who appears elf-like, with golden hair and a well toned build.  He is clad in white and gold hues, including a golden cloak and shimmering armor.

In battle he carries his *Radiant Blade* and *Mirror Shield* proudly; while these are not as powerful as many weapons of the archfey, Zarion uses them to great effect to lead the Spring Court.

Zarion favors using his strength and skills to help lead his fellows in battle, favoring protective magic, healing, and guidance over raw power.  This makes him an invulable asset to the Spring Court, whose members often lack personal power.  He is a successful teacher, and delights in helping his students shine, both on and off the battlefield.

Zarion served in the Summer Court before the Equinox Wars, only coming to Lenola's service after seeing her kindness in action.  A relatively young faerie lord, he was the most promising student of Etelgarth before becoming a renowned knight on his own.  He earned the title of Knight of Bright Dawn due to his use of radiant magic, as well as his bright and shining personality.

Zarion enjoys celebrations, music, and dancing.  He can be an incouragable flirt with a receptive partner, but does not push his advances where not needed.  He has had many lovers, and no small number of elves can trace their ancestry back to themm
