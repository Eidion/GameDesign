# Magic of Healing and Protection

> **Design Goal** - To provide options for players who want to play characters focused on healing and defensive magic.  In core rules, there are limited viable options for healing; most healing provides limited restoration compared to the damage dealt by adversaries of an appropriate challenge, and it is better to do first aid and triage than to try to prevent wounds from happening.
While this might be fine for some game tones, there are players who like to play support roles such as healers and defenders.  These supplemental rules are intended to offer these.

> **Warning** - the healing spells found in this ruleset are intended to be more powerful than the core rules, and are guided by the idea that a character using healing magic should be able to heal a comparible amount of damage that an adversary can put out in a standard turn.  For example, if an appropriately challenging enemy for the party deals about 48 damage a turn, then a character using healing magic and resources should be able to heal more than 30 points of damage at the cost of a resource.
