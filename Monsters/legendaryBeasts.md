# Legendary Beasts

Legendary beasts are monsters that resemble animals and beasts, but are larger, more fierce, and more violent than their natural peers.  Instead of being seen as part of the natural order, they are dangerous threats.  Most of them as Monstrosities, as they are magically enhanced or tied to dark magic.

* Crag Serpent

## Demonic Wolves

### Description

Demonic wolves are the product of dark magic, twisting natural animals.  Demonic wolves are created when dark spirits possess a wolf, and imbue them with dark desires.  This process transforms the wolves from beasts to monstrosities, and increases their size and ferocity greatly.  When this occurs, the wolf abandons its pack and begins to prowl on its own, hunting and killing whatever it can find.  Not just to eat, but to cause pain and suffering to people and beasts alike.

Sometimes, these creatures will create territories in wild lands such as deep forests and mountains that can sustain their bloodlust; these become Great Demonic Wolves.  However, it is more commonn that individuals will often encroach in to the borderlands to attack and kill the livestock (and citizens) of villages and freeholds.  When that happens, villages will often hire adventurers to hunt down these beasts.
