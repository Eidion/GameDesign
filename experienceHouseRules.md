# Experience Points Hack

> Design Problem - by the book experience points are a lot of overhead and additions without a clear understanding of when a level is coming, without checking a table that isn't transparent.  In addition, it is hard for individual events to "show" an impact.

The below experience system replaces the experience points and leveling system from the core rulebook.

## Leveling Up

Characters start out with 0 experience points.  By completing quests, overcoming adversaries, and making discoveries, they gain experience points.  Once they reach 100 XP, they are able to level.  Their experience points reset to 0, and they are able to gain a new level.

Any remaining experience points are halved and applied to the new level's experience points total.

### Starter Level Variants

You might look at levels 1, 2, and 3 as training levels.  If that is the case, you might want to accelerate progression through these levels.

If that is the case, you can triple experience awards to level 1 characters, and double awards to level 2 characters.

In practice, this means that it will take five challenging adversaries (5 XP each, so 75 XP total) and one dangerous adversary (10 XP, so 30 XP total).

It also means that to achieve level 3 after that will take two dangerous adversaries (10 XP each, so 40 XP total) and four challenging adversaries (5 XP each, so 40 XP total), and the completion of a quest (10 XP, so 20 XP total).

You can tweak this further if you wish, by making level 1 only take 50 XP to obtain, and level 2 take 75 XP to obtain.

### Training Variant Rules

If you are using training house rules or other rules that control when and how a level can be gained, once the experience threshold is met, then you have two options:

- Characters cannot gain more experience.  Once they reach 100 experience points, they are capped until they train.  Until they reflect on their experiences and have down time, they are not able to learn anything new.  They are effectively burned out until they are able to recover.
- Characters gain more experience, but at a reduced rate.  Cut any experience rewards in half until they level.  In addition, their total experience point total cannot become higher than 99 until they level.

## Awarding Experience Points

Experience points are rewarded for overcoming adversaries, completing quests, and making discoveries.

### Overcoming Adversaries

Characters can be awarded experience for overcoming adversaries, based on the challenge of the adversary relative to the level of the player.

| Adversary Level | Challenge Rating |  Experience Award | 
|-|-|-|
| Laughable | Level - 6 | 0 XP |
| Weak | Level - 4  |  1 XP | 
| Challenging | Level +/- 3 | 5 XP | 
| Dangerous | Level + 4 | 10 XP | 
| Deadly | Level + 6 | 15 XP |

An adversary is any NPC who has an opposed goal to your character.  Overcoming them may involve convincing them to abandon their path, avoiding them or escaping their pursuit, or by beating them in combat.  Other options are available as well, but in general it should be placed in to one of the following method:

- **Parley** for when you decieve, persuade, intimidate, or otherwise overcome and adversary through discussion or argument.  No one is harmed, and the adversary's perspective has changed.
- **Bypass** for when you sneak past, evade, or otherwise overcome and adversary without direct combat.
- **Defeat** for when you face an adversary in combat, and defeat them (with or without killing them).

Experience points can be rewarded for any of these methods, and the different methods can be used for the same adversary at different times.

For example, if a character defeats an opponent in battle, takes them captive, and then is able to convince them to give up vital information, the character would be rewarded experience points fo both defeating them and parleying with them.

However, the DM should not award experience for repeated use of the same method.  Defeating an opponent, and then letting them rest up and challenging them to a duel, will not yield another award.  Nor will sneaking past the same guard multiple times.

The difference is if there is a change in circumstances.  For example, if the party defeats an enemy knight, who then swears revenge and quests for a magic sword to slay the party, then defeating the knight again should reward additional experience awards.

Depending on the nature of the conflict with the adversary, the DM may decide that in that situation the adversary has an adversary level not reflected by their CR.  For example, a skilled negotiator with several tricks up his sleeves might be a dangerous adversary at the negotiation table, but a laughable threat if the party decides to knife him in an alley.
