# Brainstorming Campaign Ideas

## Festival at Four Kings

Four Kings is a border town between the elves, dwarves, orcs, and humans.  Once it was ruled over by different kingdoms, but now it is under its own rulership of the Town Master.  As a trading hub, it is cosmopolitan, but also rough and tumble.  Goods, ideas, and anger gets traded here very often.

It is having its big autumn festival before winter sets in.  It's the last flurry of trading, along with a time for ceremonies and rituals.

PCs are going to gather here, with such goals as:

- Winning the fencing tournament, archery contest, or other item.
- Purchasing rare items, like spell scrolls, spell focuses, or others.

## Gods as physical presences in the world

- Gods are real
- Gods have a physical body
- Gods dwell in their temples physically
- Gods sleep a lot.
