## Religions

### The Holy Defender

**Domains**: Light, Healing

The Holy Defender is worshipped by the majority of humans in the Heartland.  They follow the teachings of Erath Maxim, a human soldier who rallied a human army to slay the Dark Invaders centuries ago; they say that Maxim became a god after his death in the war, and continues to protect all people who call to him.

### The Three Aspects

**Domains**: Knowledge, Order, War

The Three Aspects are worshipped in the Great Empire to the south; they are a three-in-one essence of the Sage, the King, and the Warrior.  Followers beleive that they should attempt to become wise, become strong leaders, and become able to serve in battle.

### The Old Ways

**Domains**: Nature, Tempest

The Old Ways are the path that the elves and some members of the Borderlands follow - they pray to an Earth Mother and Sky Father for weather and natural boons, in forest temples.

### The Forge Master

**Domains**: Forge, Grave

The dwarves believe they were created by a Forge Master who resides under ground, as one of his greatest works.  They emulate him by crafting works of art.  The Forge Master also seeks to reforge what is lost or ruined; reforging dwarves in to new dwarves when they die.  Proper burial rights are key as a result.
