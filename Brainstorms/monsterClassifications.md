# Monster Classification

* [Monster Classifications](./monsterClassifications.md) to learn more about the alternate classification system for monsters presented here.

[Types](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/introduction#Type) in D&D are intended to speak to the fundamental nature of a creature.  As a result, they are very specific to the planar lore and and history of the D&D "hybrid setting."

However, this can sometimes be at odds with homebrew lore.  For example, Fiends are creatures tied to the Lower Planes.  They are not native to the World, and require summoning or other processes to get in to the World to start raising hell. (pun intended)

This means that your setting needs a "Hell" like place - perhaps not specifically the Nine Hells and the Abyss mentioned in D&D's core lore, but something to tie to the Fiend type.

It also means that Fiend is not the correct type for an evil spirit native to the World.  For example, a corrupted tree spirit, or something else that emerges from the corruption of something natural.

To provide for backwards compatibility, but also to explore new ground, Monsters of Legend uses the following classification system:

- **Origin** - Detailing the cosmological creation of the creature.
- **Type** - A summary of its appearance and behavior.
- **Keywords** - That further defines the creature.  Can include heritage designators, like Elf, Orc, Dwarf, or others.  It can also include Class based designators, like Wizard, Fighter, Warlock, or others.  Creatures can have one, more than one, or no keywords.

This is presented underneath the default type line of the monster, to provide backwards compatability.

For example, the Demonic Wolf features the following:

This way, you can continue to use the existing type line if you prefer it.

## Classifying Monsters

This section details the classification elements of Origin, Types, and additional Keywords.

### Origins

Origins represent where a creature comes from in the cosmology.  They are intended to be more flexible to work with a setting, by describing what the expectations are without building significant lore.

The origins are:

- **Abberant** - Abberant creatures are creatures that *should not exist*.  They come from cold, dark, strange places far away from the good and light of the world.  In some settings, this can be the Far Realm; in others, it may be tied to some chaotic entity.  They are alien in physiology and philosophy, often having tentacles, eye stalks, and other oddities.
- **Elemental** - Elemental creatures are either from a realm of elemental energy, or made up of such energy.  In some settings, they are from an Elemental Plane or the Elemental Chaos.  In others, they might be natural forming creatures that are animated by the spirit of that material.
- **Fey** - Fey creatures are tied to nature and wonder.  They exist as an aspect of nature or of the beauty beyond the natural.
- **Immortal** - Immortal creatures that come from the heavens above, or are otherwise beyond mortal, natural life.  Powerful beings of good and evil, or great spirits of light that dwell 
- **Natural** - Natural creatures come from the World.  They are animals, people, or other things that are born 
- **Shadow** -  

### Types

- **Humanoids** – For creatures that match the general humanoid form; standing on legs at least some of the time, with hands, able to use equipment, and so on.
  - Examples: Humans, dwarves, elves, sprites, gnomes, giants, goblins
- **Beasts** – For creatures with intelligence less than 3, that are unable to communicate or use equipment.  Often quadrupeds (or more)
  - Examples: Wolves, bears, chimera
- **Magical Beasts** – For creatures with the shapes of beasts, but a higher intelligence and ability to communicate or use magic.
  - Examples: Dragons, unicorns
- **Animates** – For creatures that resemble objects
  - Examples: Treants, animated statues
- **Spirits** – For creatures without a physical body
  - Examples: Wraiths, ghosts


## Using Classifications with Existing Material

This section details how to use the classification with existing materials.

### PC Ancestries

Any Player Character ancestry can be represented as a *Natural Humanoid* with key words based on their ancestry name.  So elves have the elf keyword, dwarves have the dwarf keyword, and squigglebottoms have the squigglebottom keyword.

Some ancestries have features that indicate that they are descended from a different origin, but that their origin has become muddied.  *Fey Ancestry*, for example, indicates that the character is descended from peoples with the Fey origin, but at this time have become native to the natural world.

Some ancestries have a different type than humanoid.  Fey is one that is particularly common.  In this case, being a "Fey Humanoid" with the appropriate keyword is the appropriate classification for the PC.

### Enchantment Spells

Within the Enchantment school, there are a family of spells that interact with type:

- Charm Person
- Hold Person
- Dominate Person
- Charm Monster
- Hold Monster
- Dominate Monster

These spells are paired together by effect, with the available targets for the spells being determined by type.  *Person* spells target humanoids.  *Monster* spells target all types.  The spell level for these effects reflect the relative power; Charm Person is a level 1 spell, while Charm Monster is a level 4 spell.

With the updated types, the *Monster* spells work fine.  But restricting the effectiveness of the *Person* spells requires that they would instead work on *Natural Humanoids* instead.

There are other spells, like Animal Friendship, that care about something being an animal.  In this system, an animal is a "natural beast."
