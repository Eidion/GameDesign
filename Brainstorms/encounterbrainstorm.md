# Probably in to the session 

## A forgotten shrine

More of an RP encounter, a shrine that could be restored and cared for to get a divine blessing.

## Mad Treant

A treant who has been burned and is at half HP.  It is enraged.  The party can try to calm it down, or give it what mercy they can

## Slavers

A group of bugbears are out collecting victims, and taking them back to a war camp of hobgoblins and ogres.  The party could fight off the bugbears, and then decide to warn a nearby village about the slavers, and possibly decide to defend against them.

# Still a maybe...
## Ettercaps

An ettercap and its three giant spider buddies have webbed part of the forest, making it hard to get through.  They attack the party with some hit and run tactics.  The party can try to kill them out right, can try to track them to the lair, or try to rush through.

## Ettin

Two heads are better than one - and it is a big dumb monster.  (then again, they just fought big dumb monsters a lot)

## Oni

I love them.  It can pretend to be a lost child, and possibly interact with the slaver plot.

## Displacer Beast

This seems to work well with a forest area that used to be tied to ancient elves.  On that note...

## Banshee

Someone killed in the battle that locked the ancient keep up.


## Owl Druid

An orcish owl druid will visit them.  Curious about what is going on.  Can give some exposition.

## Elven Scouts

Perhaps the elves are the target of the slave raids.  They perhaps need help

## Lost Child

Lost child, possibly rescued from an Ettin, Ettercap Displacer Beast, or Bugbears - leads the party to civilization.


## Therinthropes

A wereboar or werebear, to play around and explore Root's shifter side.

## Young Green Dragon

They got a dungeon last time sooo..
