# Monsters of Legend

This project is focused on creating monsters with the following design statement:

> Monsters of Legend seeks to bring the more dynamic and challenging legendary encounters found at high levels, in to lower levels by creating legendary monsters that can be encountered by low level characters in the dark and wild places of the fantasy setting.

The [Monster Template](templateMonster.md) is used to create standard formatted monsters.
