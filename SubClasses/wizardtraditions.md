# Wizard Traditions

In the setting of Nerath, many wizards do not cling to specific schools of magic as the focus and boundaries of study.  Instead, they belong to arcane orders with specific teachings, history, and goals.  Each of these orders confers specific magical techniques

## Golden Wyvern Initiates

* The Golden Wyverns were the Nerath Legion's most well regarded war-wizard division.
* While they used powerful battle magic, they also taught control - they worked well with the front lines, able to weave their area spells to not damage allies.
* When the gnolls invaded Nerath and burned the city, the Golden Wyverns disbanded; their members joined with mercenary groups made up of former legionnaires.
* Over time, their learnings spread out, so that many battle mages claim to follow the Golden Wyvern tradition.
* However, true Golden Wyvern initiates boast teachings and a greater control over destructive magic, and can often trace the line of their studies to a specific Nerathi wizard.

### Tactical Wit
Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

### Sculpt Spells
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your spells. When you cast a spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Spellcasting
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard spell you cast.

### Overchannel
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

## Order of the Emerald Orb

* The Emerald Orb is began as an ascetic tradition focused on understanding the mysteries of arcane magic.  
* They focused on the less physical manifestations of magic, and on using magic to hinder and bind, more than destroy.
* This once reclusive group became more active in the world after one of their members went rogue and had to be hunted down and killed.
* Some members became disenfranchised with the group, and used their power to gather wealth and political power.
* Now, there are seen as two branches of the Emerald Orb tradition - those who were taught by the order itself, and those who were taught by (or can trace their training back to) those who left.
* Members of the organization consider the others traitors or pretenders.


## Greystone Conservatory

* The Greystone Conservatory tradition is a newer tradition, having been founded after the fall of Nerath.
* In the chaos of the collapse, wizards and scholars from the imperial university came together to try to protect as much of the learning as possible.
* They secreted many books and scrolls to a fortress on a snowy magical peak, and christened their new order.
* Wizards were sent out by the order to gather old books and treasures, as well as to investigate what was going on in the world.  Over time, they began building chapter houses in cities to share the knowledge that they had hoarded.
* Through this process, the Greystone Conservatory began to focus on protective and support magic, the better to serve their communities.

### Spellbook Savant
Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook is halved.

## Hedgemages

* Hedgemages lack a specific tradition, but instead have learned unorthodox styles of magic.
* While many members of more formal traditions look down on hedgemages, the fact is that hedgemages often innovate and develop techniques that are beyond what more ancient traditions are capable of.
